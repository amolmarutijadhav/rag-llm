# Connection Pooling Test Failure Analysis

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Why Tests Started Failing After Connection Pooling Implementation**

The 6 test cases that were previously passing started failing after the connection pooling enhancement due to a fundamental change in how HTTP clients are managed:

#### **Before Connection Pooling (Original Implementation)**
```python
# Original implementation in base_provider.py
async with httpx.AsyncClient(**self._get_client_kwargs()) as client:
    response = await client.request(**request_kwargs)
```

**Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ **New client per request**: Each API call created a fresh `httpx.AsyncClient`
- ‚úÖ **Automatic cleanup**: Client was automatically closed after each request
- ‚úÖ **Test isolation**: No shared state between requests
- ‚úÖ **Event loop friendly**: No persistent connections to manage

#### **After Connection Pooling (Enhanced Implementation)**
```python
# New implementation with connection pooling
client = await self._get_async_client()  # Persistent client
response = await client.request(**request_kwargs)
```

**Characteristics:**
- ‚ùå **Persistent clients**: HTTP clients are reused across multiple requests
- ‚ùå **Shared state**: Clients maintain connection pools that can become invalid
- ‚ùå **Event loop dependency**: Clients depend on event loop lifecycle
- ‚ùå **Test environment issues**: Event loops are closed between tests

## üö® **Specific Failure Patterns**

### **Error Messages Observed**
```
AttributeError("'NoneType' object has no attribute 'send'")
RuntimeError('Event loop is closed')
```

### **When Failures Occur**
1. **First API call (OpenAI)**: ‚úÖ Usually succeeds
2. **Second API call (Qdrant)**: ‚ùå Often fails with connection errors
3. **Test environment**: Event loops are closed between tests
4. **Concurrent execution**: Multiple tests running simultaneously

### **Test Cases Affected**
1. `test_upload_text_with_context_success` - Context-aware RAG test
2. `test_real_docx_ocr_with_chart_image` - OCR functionality test
3. `test_real_pdf_ocr_with_form_image` - OCR functionality test
4. `test_real_docx_ocr_with_receipt_image` - OCR functionality test
5. `test_ocr_text_extraction_accuracy` - OCR accuracy test
6. `test_ocr_with_actual_document_processing` - OCR integration test

## üîß **Fix Implementation**

### **Client Validity Check and Recreation**

The fix adds client validity checks to detect when persistent clients become invalid and automatically recreate them:

#### **Async Client Fix**
```python
async def _get_async_client(self) -> httpx.AsyncClient:
    # ... existing client creation logic ...
    
    # Check if the client is still valid (for test environments)
    try:
        # Try to access a property to check if client is still valid
        _ = self._async_client._transport
        return self._async_client
    except (AttributeError, RuntimeError):
        # Client is invalid, create a new one
        logger.warning(f"Async client became invalid, creating new one")
        async with self._client_lock:
            # Close the old client if it exists
            if self._async_client is not None:
                try:
                    await self._async_client.aclose()
                except:
                    pass
            # Create new client
            self._async_client = httpx.AsyncClient(**self._get_client_kwargs())
        return self._async_client
```

#### **Sync Client Fix**
```python
def _get_sync_client(self) -> httpx.Client:
    # ... existing client creation logic ...
    
    # Check if the client is still valid (for test environments)
    try:
        # Try to access a property to check if client is still valid
        _ = self._sync_client._transport
        return self._sync_client
    except (AttributeError, RuntimeError):
        # Client is invalid, create a new one
        logger.warning(f"Sync client became invalid, creating new one")
        with self._sync_client_lock:
            # Close the old client if it exists
            if self._sync_client is not None:
                try:
                    self._sync_client.close()
                except:
                    pass
            # Create new client
            self._sync_client = httpx.Client(**self._get_client_kwargs())
        return self._sync_client
```
