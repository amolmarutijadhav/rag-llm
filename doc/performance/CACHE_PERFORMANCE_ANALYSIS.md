## Root Cause Analysis of Previous Issues
### Issues Identified and Resolved:
1. **API Call Tracking Issue**: The original performance test was tracking calls on the wrong providers (service locator providers instead of RAG service providers)
2. **Cache Integration**: The cache was actually working correctly, but the tracking mechanism was not capturing the calls
3. **Plugin Failures**: These were false positives due to the tracking mechanism not working properly

### Resolution:
- **Fixed API call tracking** by replacing methods on RAG service providers instead of service locator providers
- **Verified cache integration** is working perfectly
- **Confirmed all plugins** are functioning correctly
