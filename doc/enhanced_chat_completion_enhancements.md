# Enhanced Chat Completion Service - Multi-Turn Conversation Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the enhancements made to the `enhanced_chat_completion_service.py` to better support multi-turn conversations and goal-oriented tasks like Business Requirement Document (BRD) preparation.

## Current Limitations

### 1. Single-Message Retrieval
- **Issue**: Only uses the last user message for RAG retrieval
- **Impact**: Misses context from previous conversation turns
- **Example**: User asks "Can you update that policy?" - "that" refers to previous context

### 2. No Conversation History Integration
- **Issue**: Retrieval doesn't consider conversation flow or goal progression
- **Impact**: Poor recall for follow-up questions and context-dependent queries
- **Example**: BRD preparation requires understanding the entire conversation thread

### 3. Limited Query Enhancement
- **Issue**: Only generates topic/entity variants of the last message
- **Impact**: Misses important context clues and conversation state
- **Example**: Doesn't capture the user's current goal or task progress

## Recommended Enhancements

### 1. Condensed Standalone Query Generation

**Purpose**: Convert recent conversation turns into a self-contained query that resolves pronouns and includes key context.

**Implementation**:
```python
def condense_to_standalone_question(messages: List[ChatMessage], max_turns: int = 5) -> str:
    """
    Generate a standalone question from recent conversation turns.
    
    Args:
        messages: Recent conversation messages (last N turns)
        max_turns: Maximum number of turns to consider
    
    Returns:
        Condensed standalone question
    """
```

**Example**:
```
Conversation:
- User: "We're migrating SME risk scoring to Basel III"
- Assistant: "Key changes include stricter RWA calculations"
- User: "What about the documentation requirements?"

Condensed Query:
"Basel III SME risk scoring migration documentation requirements"
```

### 2. Short Summary Query Generation

**Purpose**: Create a 1-2 sentence summary of recent conversation that captures goal, scope, and constraints.

**Implementation**:
```python
def summarize_recent_context(messages: List[ChatMessage], max_turns: int = 5) -> str:
    """
    Generate a summary query from recent conversation context.
    
    Args:
        messages: Recent conversation messages
        max_turns: Maximum number of turns to consider
    
    Returns:
        Summary query for retrieval
    """
```

**Example**:
```
Conversation:
- User: "I need to prepare a BRD for Basel III compliance"
- Assistant: "I'll help you structure the document"
- User: "What sections should I include?"

Summary Query:
"Business requirement document for Basel III compliance sections and structure"
```

### 3. Conversation State Tracking

**Purpose**: Track conversation state, goals, and progress to improve retrieval relevance.

**Implementation**:
```python
@dataclass
class ConversationState:
    """Track conversation state and goals"""
    current_goal: str
    conversation_phase: str  # "planning", "drafting", "reviewing", "finalizing"
    key_entities: List[str]
    constraints: List[str]
    progress_markers: List[str]
    next_steps: List[str]
```

### 4. Enhanced Query Strategy

**Purpose**: Implement multiple query generation strategies for different conversation types.

**Strategies**:
1. **Goal-Oriented**: Focus on current task/goal
2. **Context-Aware**: Include recent conversation context
3. **Entity-Tracking**: Track key entities across turns
4. **Phase-Specific**: Different queries based on conversation phase

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements
1. Add condensed query generation
2. Add summary query generation
3. Implement conversation state tracking
4. Update query generation pipeline

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Add goal-oriented query strategies
2. Implement conversation phase detection
3. Add entity tracking across turns
4. Implement context-aware filtering

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Add query deduplication and ranking
2. Implement adaptive query generation
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Optimize token usage

## Benefits

### 1. Improved Context Retention
- Better handling of follow-up questions
- Resolves pronoun references
- Maintains conversation continuity

### 2. Goal-Oriented Retrieval
- Better support for complex tasks (BRD preparation)
- Tracks progress and next steps
- Maintains focus on current objective

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- More relevant responses
- Better conversation flow
- Reduced need for clarification

### 4. Scalability
- Supports longer conversations
- Handles complex multi-step tasks
- Maintains performance with conversation growth

## Usage Examples

### BRD Preparation Scenario

```
User: "I need to prepare a BRD for Basel III compliance"
Assistant: "I'll help you create a comprehensive BRD. Let me gather relevant information about Basel III requirements."

User: "What sections should I include?"
Assistant: "Based on Basel III compliance requirements, your BRD should include: [sections with context]"

User: "Can you help me draft the executive summary?"
Assistant: "Here's a draft executive summary for your Basel III compliance BRD: [context-aware content]"
```

### Multi-Turn Context Handling

```
User: "What are the key changes in Basel III?"
Assistant: "Basel III introduces several key changes: [detailed response]"

User: "How do these affect our current risk models?"
Assistant: "Based on the Basel III changes I mentioned, your risk models need updates in: [context-aware response]"

User: "Can you provide specific implementation steps?"
Assistant: "Here are the implementation steps for updating your risk models based on Basel III requirements: [context-aware steps]"
```

## Configuration Options

### Query Generation Settings
```python
QUERY_GENERATION_CONFIG = {
    "max_conversation_turns": 5,
    "condensed_query_weight": 0.4,
    "summary_query_weight": 0.3,
    "original_query_weight": 0.3,
    "enable_goal_tracking": True,
    "enable_phase_detection": True
}
```

### Conversation State Settings
```python
CONVERSATION_STATE_CONFIG = {
    "max_entities_tracked": 10,
    "max_constraints_tracked": 5,
    "state_persistence_turns": 10,
    "goal_detection_threshold": 0.7
}
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Context Retention**: How well context is maintained across turns
2. **Query Relevance**: Relevance scores of generated queries
3. **Response Quality**: User satisfaction with responses
4. **Conversation Flow**: Natural progression of conversations
5. **Goal Achievement**: Success rate of goal-oriented tasks

### Logging Enhancements

logger.info("Multi-turn conversation processed", extra={
    'extra_fields': {
        'conversation_length': len(messages),
        'condensed_query': condensed_query,
        'summary_query': summary_query,
        'goal_detected': conversation_state.current_goal,
        'phase': conversation_state.conversation_phase,
        'entities_tracked': len(conversation_state.key_entities)
    }
})
```
