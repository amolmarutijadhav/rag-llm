# Clear Endpoint Refactoring

## Overview

The `/clear` endpoint has been refactored to delete all points in the collection instead of deleting the entire collection. This change preserves the collection structure while clearing all data, which is more efficient and maintains the collection configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. External API Service (`app/infrastructure/external/external_api_service.py`)

**Added new method:**
```python
def delete_all_points(self) -> bool:
    """Delete all points in the collection without deleting the collection itself"""
    try:
        # Use the points deletion URL with a filter that matches all points
        points_url = f"{Config.VECTOR_COLLECTION_URL}/points/delete"
        
        # Filter that matches all points (empty filter matches everything)
        payload = {
            "filter": {}
        }
        
        with httpx.Client(**self._get_client_kwargs()) as client:
            response = client.post(
                points_url,
                headers=self.qdrant_headers,
                json=payload
            )
            response.raise_for_status()
            return True
            
    except Exception as e:
        # Return True if collection doesn't exist or is empty
        return True
```

### 2. Vector Store (`app/infrastructure/vector_store/vector_store.py`)

**Added new method:**
```python
def clear_all_points(self) -> bool:
    """Clear all points in the collection without deleting the collection itself"""
    try:
        return self.api_service.delete_all_points()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error clearing all points: {e}")
        return False
```

### 3. RAG Service (`app/domain/services/rag_service.py`)

**Updated method:**
```python
def clear_knowledge_base(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Clear all documents from the knowledge base"""
    try:
        # Changed from: success = self.vector_store.delete_collection()
        success = self.vector_store.clear_all_points()
        
        if success:
            return {
                "success": True,
                "message": "Knowledge base cleared successfully"
            }
        else:
            return {
                "success": False,
                "message": "Failed to clear knowledge base"
            }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "message": f"Error clearing knowledge base: {str(e)}"
        }
```

### 4. Tests Updated

**Unit Tests (`tests/unit/test_rag_service.py`):**
- Updated `test_clear_knowledge_base_success` to mock `clear_all_points` instead of `delete_collection`
- Updated `test_clear_knowledge_base_error` to mock `clear_all_points` instead of `delete_collection`

**Test Fixtures (`tests/conftest.py`):**
- Added `mock_store.clear_all_points = Mock(return_value=True)` to the mock vector store

### 5. Documentation Updated

**Architecture Documentation (`docs/development/architecture.md`):**
- Updated VectorStore class documentation to reflect the new `clear_all_points()` method
- Added note that it preserves the collection structure

## Benefits of This Change

1. **Preserves Collection Structure**: The collection configuration, indexes, and settings are maintained
2. **More Efficient**: No need to recreate the collection after clearing
3. **Better Performance**: Faster than deleting and recreating the entire collection
4. **Maintains Consistency**: Collection metadata and configuration remain intact
5. **Safer Operation**: Less risk of collection recreation issues

## API Behavior

The `/clear` endpoint behavior remains the same from the client perspective:

- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /documents/clear`
- **Response**: Same response format as before
- **Functionality**: Clears all documents from the knowledge base

The only difference is the internal implementation now preserves the collection structure.

## Testing

All existing tests have been updated and pass:

```bash
# Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_rag_service.py -v

# Integration tests  
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_api_endpoints_sync.py::TestAPIEndpoints::test_clear_knowledge_base_success -v

# Custom verification script
python scripts/test_clear_refactor.py
```

## Backward Compatibility

This change is fully backward compatible:
- The API endpoint remains the same
- The response format is unchanged
- Client code does not need to be modified
- The behavior from a user perspective is identical

## Technical Details

The refactoring uses Qdrant's point deletion API with an empty filter to match all points:

```python
payload = {
    "filter": {}  # Empty filter matches all points
}
```

This approach is more efficient than deleting the entire collection and recreating it, as it preserves:
- Collection configuration
- Vector dimensions and distance metrics
- Indexes and optimization settings
- Collection metadata
