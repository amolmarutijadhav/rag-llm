# RAG LLM API â€“ API Documentation

## Overview
A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API built with FastAPI, LangChain, and Qdrant Cloud. This API enables document upload, text ingestion, semantic search, and question answering using configurable LLM providers and Qdrant vector database with robust field handling.

---

## Key Features

- **Externalized API Configuration**: All external API endpoints are fully configurable via environment variables
- **Robust Field Handling**: Compatible with different field naming conventions (`content` and `page_content`)
- **Complete URL Support**: No path appending - URLs are used directly as configured
- **Collection Management**: Dedicated collection URL for operations like stats and deletion
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of missing or malformed payloads

## Technical Details

### Field Handling
The API now handles inconsistent field names in vector database payloads:
- **Primary Field**: `"content"` - Standard field name for document content
- **Fallback Field**: `"page_content"` - Alternative field name for compatibility
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or malformed payloads
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing data that uses different field names

### External API Configuration
- **Complete URLs**: All external API endpoints are fully configurable
- **No Path Appending**: URLs are used directly without modification
- **Flexible Provider Support**: Easy switching between different service providers
- **Collection Management**: Dedicated `VECTOR_COLLECTION_URL` for collection operations

### Vector Database Operations
- **Collection Creation**: Automatic collection creation if it doesn't exist
- **Vector Insertion**: Batch insertion of document vectors with metadata
- **Semantic Search**: Cosine similarity search with configurable top-k results
- **Collection Statistics**: Real-time statistics about stored documents
- **Collection Management**: Full collection lifecycle management

## Recent Updates

### Search Functionality Fix (Latest)
- **Issue**: Search was failing due to inconsistent field names (`"content"` vs `"page_content"`)
- **Solution**: Added robust field handling in `VectorStore.search()` method
- **Result**: Search now works with both field naming conventions
- **Impact**: Improved compatibility with existing data and different document sources

### External API Externalization
- **Complete URL Configuration**: All external API endpoints are now fully configurable
- **No Path Appending**: URLs are used directly without modification
- **Flexible Provider Support**: Easy switching between different service providers
- **Collection Management**: Dedicated `VECTOR_COLLECTION_URL` for collection operations
